						<h2>1. What is punk?</h2>
						<p id="test">
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>The sound</h3>
						<div class='song' id='god-save-the-queen'></div>
						<p class="text">
							The basic punk sound is vocals, electric guitar, electric bass, and drums playing a song with a simple chord structure, generous distortion, and an uptempo beat. 
						</p>
						<p class="small text">
							You don't have to be particularly good at your instrument.<br/>
							Sometimes it helps not to be.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>The attitude</h3>
						<div class='song' id='sonic-reducer'></div>
						<p class="text">
							Aggressive, emotional, ferocious, youthful. 
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>The ethos</h3>
						<div class='song' id='give-me-the-cure'></div>
						<p class="text">
							Do-it-yourself (DIY). Write your own songs, record in your own basement, release your own albums, organize your own concerts. Don't lose control of your artistic product. 
						</p>
						<p class="small text">
							Fugazi was particularly well respected for this - for years they released albums on their own label and arranged their own shows. 
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>The politics</h3>
						<div class='song' id='career-opportunities'></div>
						<p class="text">
							Generally left-wing. Identification with the poor and working class. Distrust of the government and of the wealthy. Some revolutionary rhetoric. 
						</p>
						<p class="small text">
							Some far-right, often unsavory political movements have also adopted punk.<br/>
							Other politically-oriented punk fans hate them probably worst of all. 
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="big text">
							Different people think different aspects of punk are the most important, and so it ends up meaning different things from person to person. 
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>2. Sped up rock 'n' roll</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="big text">
							The root influence of the punk sound is just older-style rock 'n' roll, played faster and louder and with more rawness. 
						</p>
						<p class="big text">
							Sometimes this influence can be heard explicitly in the form of a cover. 
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Let's Dance</h3>
						<div class='songblock'>
							<span class='song' id='lets-dance-chris-montez'></span>
							<span class='song' id='lets-dance-ramones'></span>
						</div>
						<p class="small text">
							Chris Montez (1962) covered by the Ramones (1976)
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Soul Kitchen</h3>
						<div class='songblock'>
							<span class='song' id='soul-kitchen-doors'></span>
							<span class='song' id='soul-kitchen-x'></span>
						</div>
						<p class="small text">
							The Doors (1967) covered by X (1980). The album with X's rendition was produced by Ray Manzarek, the Doors' keyboardist. 
						</p>

						<h2>3. Trajectories</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="big text">
							Led by the Sex Pistols and the Ramones, punk exploded into popular music in the late 1970s. 
						</p>
						<p class="big text">
							Many bands quickly took punk and ran in new directions. 
						</p>
						<p class="big text">
							You could spend a lifetime examining these trajectories. Here's just one. 
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>This could be the Pistols</h3>
						<div class='song' id='warsaw'></div>
						<p class="text">
							Joy Division were a band from Manchester formed in 1976 whose members drew inspiration from seeing the Sex Pistols live. 
						</p>
						<p class="text">
							This is one of their early songs. It sounds like standard punk. 
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>This sounds different</h3>
						<div class='song' id='shadowplay'></div>
						<p class="text">
							This is from their debut album, <i>Unknown Pleasures</i> (1979). It still has the same sort of instrumentation but is less harsh and more atmospheric. The song structure does not feature the usual verse, chorus, verse. 
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>More electronics</h3>
						<div class='song' id='temptation'></div>
						<p class="text">
							Joy Division's singer, Ian Curtis, killed himself in 1980, and the rest of the band recast itself as New Order. This is an early song that shows the more synthesized, electronic direction that they would take. 
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>By now we're dancing</h3>
						<div class='song' id='blue-monday'></div>
						<p class="text">
							In 1983 New Order scored a massive hit with this song. 
						</p>
						<p class="small text">
							It doesn't resemble the original sound of 7 years prior. 
						</p>
						<p class="small text">
							It was terribly popular, even among people who never would have found themselves listening to Johnny Rotten snarl in some dank club. But it was made by people who did, and who then went out and started a punk band. 
						</p>
						<p class="small text">
							And it's still very good music (at least I think so). Is it "punk"?
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Modern influence</h3>
						<div class='song' id='kids'></div>
						<p class="text">
							Here's an example of a modern song that prominently wears its influence from this branch of music. 
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>4. Alternative</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="big text">
							Punk grew steadily in the 1980s, but its popularity really took off in the early 1990s. 
						</p>
						<p class="big text">
							The sound of punk permanently entered the mainstream, somewhat ironically in a form labeled "alternative." 
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Post-punk</h3>
						<div class='songblock'>
							<span class='song' id='where-is-my-mind'></span>
							<span class='song' id='pink-turns-to-blue'></span>
							<span class='song' id='teen-age-riot'></span>
						</div>
						<p class="text">
							In the 1980s American "post-punk" bands kept the distorted electric guitar sound but slowed things down, got more melodious, wrote more elaborate song structures, and emphasized artistry over attitude and politics. 
						</p>
						<p class="small text">
							This style of music is probably my personal favorite. 
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Nirvana</h3>
						<div class='song' id='smells-like-teen-spirit'></div>
						<p class="text">
							In the late 1980s and early 1990s, this genre burst into widespread prominence, spearheaded by Nirvana and the Seattle scene from which they came. 
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Other major-label jumpers</h3>
						<p>
							<div style="width: 47.5%; float: left; text-align: right; clear: none;">
								<div style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Earlier/independent</div>
								<div class='songblock'>
									<span class='small-song' id='freak-scene'></span>
									<span class='small-song' id='chesterfield-king'></span>
									<span class='small-song' id='another-state-of-mind'></span>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div style="width: 47.5%; float: right; text-align: left; clear: none;">
								<div style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Later/major label</div>
								<div class='songblock'>
									<span class='small-song' id='feel-the-pain'></span>
									<span class='small-song' id='chemistry'></span>
									<span class='small-song' id='ball-and-chain'></span>
								</div>
							</div>
						</p>
						<p class="text">
							During this time many similar bands were also signed out of more underground scenes by major labels, receiving national exposure. 
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							These bands drew from a variety of influences of which punk was just one. (Folk, art rock, metal, country, hopefully a little made-up brand new shit too...) 
						</p>
						<p>
							But you can continue to hear the sounds of old 70s-era punk in music that is considered very mainstream today. 
						</p>

						<h2>5. The spirit of punk</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="text">
							So far we've emphasized the sonic qualities of what people think of as punk. But for some people, "punk" has more to do a way of thinking and an artistic approach than what the actual music sounds like. 
						</p>
						<p class="text">
							To them, the most important thing about "punk" isn't how it sounds, but the idea of pushing artistic boundaries, spreading messages of social justice, and DIY. 
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>"...But everyone who [did] started a band"</h3>
						<div class='song' id='heroin'></div>
						<p class="text">
							The Velvet Underground is considered a major forerunner of punk, even though they don't sound much like the late 1970s punk bands. 
						</p>
						<p class="text">
							They had a big influence on many musicians that took the punk sound and went in more melodically and lyrically thoughtful directions. 
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Quieter stuff</h3>
						<div class='song' id='down-at-the-sea'></div>
						<p class="text">
							A lot of bands who liked punk music retained the ethos and the emotion but adopted a lighter, "poppier" sound. 
						</p>
						<p class="small text">
							Beat Happening doesn't <em>sound</em> like punk. But they and their label K Records have been active participants and supporters of punk bands, and have remained fiercely independent and DIY. 
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Riot grrl</h3>
						<div class='song' id='good-things'></div>
						<p class="text">
							In the early 1990s many feminist-minded women took to punk to empower themselves and give voice to women's issues and perspectives. 
						</p>
						<p class="small text">
							Punk is sadly not free of sexism; hopefully we can get to the point where "women's bands" are just "bands." I think things are getting better. 
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Noise</h3>
						<div class='song' id='assassins'></div>
						<p class="text">
							Many people feel that you aren't really "punk" if you aren't exploring new sounds and pushing the boundaries of music. 
						</p>
						<p class="small text">
							Some people consider this unlistenable.<br/>
							I really like Lightning Bolt. These bands are not for everyone though. 
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>The mainstream</h3>
						<div class='songblock'>
							<span class='song' id='all-the-small-things'></span>
							<span class='song' id='dirty-little-secret'></span>
							<span class='song' id='my-songs-know-what-you-did-in-the-dark'></span>
						</div>
						<p class="text">
							The other side: some people consider mainstream pop-punk songs to be so far removed from the ideas of punk as not to merit the label. 
						</p>
						<p class="small text">
							I like plenty of pop music, punk-influenced and not. I don't care to debate whether something is "punk" or not. But some people do. 
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="text">
							You could argue that "punk" is such a broadly defined, disagreed-upon term as to have little meaning beyond something generally positive about music. 
						</p>
						<p class="text">
							I wouldn't wholly disagree. But the label has come to stand for a lot of the kinds of bands and songs that I like, which is why I think it's worth talking about. 
						</p>
					</section>

						<h2>The end</h2>
						<p class="text">
							These five lessons only covered a small fraction of punk music in a really simplified way. I hope they've inspired you to go listen to and learn about the rest!
