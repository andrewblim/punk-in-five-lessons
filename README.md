Presentation I made for fun and to try out [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js). It is a thinly modified fork. 

reveal.js is MIT licensed. 

Thanks to [this StackOverflow page](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13784600/how-to-deploy-node-app-that-uses-grunt-to-heroku) for the quick & dirty Grunt-based deployment.
